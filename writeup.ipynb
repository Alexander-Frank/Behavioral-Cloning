    "The model_before.py file contains the code for the initial training and saving the convolutional neural network and its weights. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works. I ran this code on an AWS server with GPU support. I had issues using the model.save() generated model when downloading it to my local machine. I worked around the problem by saving and downloading the model weights and using the load_and_save.py script to load the saved weights into the model on my local amchine and then saving it.\n",

    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model is based on the Nvidea Network architecture, which can be found [here](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of a normalization layer using a Keras lambda layer, followed by 5 convolutional layers, followed by 3 fully connected layers. I added dropout in between the colvolutional and fully connected layers, which was not used in the original model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains a dropout layer in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 228). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets using a two step training approach. First, I used the model_before.py code which does not iclude any augmentation. It only omits a some of the data of going straight and randomly flips images. The model weights were saved and loaded into the model.py code architecture, which included different data and 3 augmentation techniques, adapted from [this blog post](https://chatbotslife.com/learning-human-driving-behavior-using-nvidias-neural-network-model-and-image-augmentation-80399360efee). After looking at the blog post I decided to try out the 'he_normal' kernel initializer and ended up keeping it for my model. The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track for both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the initial model the car made it around the track at 9mph (see videos/video_before.mp4) but failed at higher speeds (see videos/video_before_20mph.mp4).\n",
    "\n",
    "After continuing training the model with my new data the car was going around the track smoother at 9mph (see videos/video.mp4) and also made it at 20mph (see videos/video_20mph.mp4). At higher speeds the car tends to ping pong between the lanes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 243).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road, smooth curve driving and going around the track the other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to use the Nvidea model architecture and tune that if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use the original Nvidea architecture. I thought this model might be appropriate because the task for which it was designed fits this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that all of my attemps yielded decent results on the mean squared error loss for both the validation and traing set. However, some models were keeping the car \"hugging\" the left lane, others ended up beeing trained too long and just driving straight (very smooth, but unfortunately it couldn't take the corners).\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model and added a droupout layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I adjusted the number of epochs, batch_size of the generator and augmentation techniques used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track, usually around the corners and the dirt curb. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I recorded additional data and used the two-step training approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the model training visualizations for both model, the model_before and model in this order).\n",

    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",

    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 206-243) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "*for further details please see Explore.ipynb*\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior for my first model training step, I recorded 2 laps driven in each dircetion on track one and special rounds with just the curvy section in each direction.\n",
